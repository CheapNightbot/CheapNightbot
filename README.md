## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning

- [ ] C++
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] PHP (didn't even start yet)
- [ ] Android Studio (ma pc == potato == lag)
- [ ] Blender (not actively)

## 🚀 My Projects

- [notTaki Website](https://nottaki.pages.dev/) - A static website for the musical artist notTaki. Unfortunately, the project is in a private repository on my old GitHub account, and I lost access to it due to technical issues. The website featured a Mouse trail effect and various other cool stuff. I'm planning to recreate it in the future.

- [Yutify: YouTube to Spotify](https://github.com/CheapNightbot-zz/Yutify) - Convert YouTube music URLs to Spotify links. Unfortunately this one also isn't finished. There are still some issues, but I don't think of working on it right now.
